# AI Code Auditor & Refactorer

This project implements an autonomous AI agent system designed to proactively identify, document, and remediate issues found in codebases generated by AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). As reliance on AI-generated code grows, hidden problems such as technical debt, inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and subtle bugs increase significantly. This agent scans repositories to detect issues that have been created and will be pass issue info to another agent to actually to fix these issues.

## Ideal Key Features When Complete:

* **Automated Pattern Recognition:** Identifies AI-generated issues including overly verbose code, hallucinated logic, insecure prompts, unnecessary boilerplate, and hidden biases.
* **Intelligent Remediation:** Automatically generates detailed pull requests with optimized code fixes, documentation links, and best-practice recommendations.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works with existing workflows including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, CI/CD pipelines, and issue trackers like Jira, Trello, and Linear.
* **Continuous Learning:** Adapts and improves by analyzing team feedback on its suggested changes.
* **Package Updating:** Keeps dependencies current, proactively updating outdated or deprecated packages.

## How to run:

* **Copy Repo** 
* **Install requirements.txt** 
* **Make sure that you have accounts for following tools in .env file** 
* **Add .env variables:** 
    ```
    # Personal github token
    GITHUB_TOKEN=""

    # Pinecone vector Db api key
    PINECONE_API_KEY=""

    # Vector database index names that you have made on pinecone (1536 dimensions)
    DOCUMENTS_VDB_INDEX = '' # ex. 'documents'
    ISSUES_VDB_INDEX = '' # ex. 'issues'

    # This is used generally by GPT researcher and langgraph stuff
    # Currently agent is hard coded to use combination of OpenAi models
    OPENAI_API_KEY=""

    # For research
    TAVILY_API_KEY=""

    # If you want langsmith tracing
    LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
    LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=""
    LANGSMITH_API_KEY=""
    LANGSMITH_PROJECT=""
    ```
* **Run:** tweak run_agent.py main function with your own 'owner', 'repo', and 'branch' for wha you want to audit, then run.
* **Visualization of Agent Graph:** [Agent Graph Visualization](https://github.com/leonard658/AI-Issue-Agent/blob/main/Agent_Graph_Visualization.png) 
    * Planning on using Context7 MCP for documentation agent
