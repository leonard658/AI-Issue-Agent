# AI Code Auditor & Refactorer

This project implements an autonomous AI agent system designed to proactively identify, document, and remediate issues found in codebases generated by AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). As reliance on AI-generated code grows, hidden problems such as technical debt, inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and subtle bugs increase significantly. This agent continuously scans repositories to detect such patterns and autonomously suggests or applies improvements.

## Ideal Key Features When Complete:

* **Automated Pattern Recognition:** Identifies AI-generated issues including overly verbose code, hallucinated logic, insecure prompts, unnecessary boilerplate, and hidden biases.
* **Intelligent Remediation:** Automatically generates detailed pull requests with optimized code fixes, documentation links, and best-practice recommendations.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works with existing workflows including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, CI/CD pipelines, and issue trackers like Jira, Trello, and Linear.
* **Continuous Learning:** Adapts and improves by analyzing team feedback on its suggested changes.
* **Package Updating:** Keeps dependencies current, proactively updating outdated or deprecated packages.

## Target Market:

* **Tech Companies:** Managing extensive AI-generated codebases efficiently.
* **AI/ML Teams:** Ensuring robust oversight of auto-generated model deployment code.
* **Fintech & Regulated Industries:** Maintaining strict compliance and security standards.
